## Instruction
Please follow the folder structure for creating the plots. You can retain the folder structure by cloning the repo. 

The folder structure is:

1. ExData_Plotting1 <- The root folder which holds all the other folders
1.1 data    <- The zipped data should be stored here. Don't change the filename
1.2 plots   <- The plots will be saved here after they are generated by the scripts
1.3 scripts <- This contains all the scripts which need to be run to generate the plots. This should be set us the working directory for running the scripts and generating the plots.

Two packages will be needed in the scripts. They will be installed if they were not installed yet.
